# PY-CL-StringPalindrome

## Overview
This Python project checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

## Files

### app.py
The app.py file serves as the main entry point for the project. It prompts the user to input a string and checks if it is a palindrome.

### palindrome.py
The palindrome.py file contains the is_palindrome function, which checks if a given string is a palindrome.

### test_palindrome.py
The test_palindrome.py file contains unit tests for the is_palindrome function.

## Project Structure
- src/
  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started
 
1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Review the code and ensure that all necessary functions from `lab.py` are imported.
3. Run the `app.py` file to see the demonstrations of different string manipulation methods.
4. Modify the `lab.py` file to complete the challenges and demonstrations.
5. Avoid making changes to the test files (`lab_test.py`).
6. Run the test cases (`lab_test.py`) to verify the correctness of your implementations.

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical implementation of checking palindromes in Python. By running the app.py script and providing input strings, users can quickly determine if a string is a palindrome or not.

Happy Coding!
